# AdventOfCode

My solutions for Advent of Code, a coding challenge where you solve problems as quickly as possible. See https://adventofcode.com/ for the full description of each problem.

To run solutions, use node to `node util/main.js run <year> <day>` to run that day's solution. For other commands, see [main.js](./util/main.js).
